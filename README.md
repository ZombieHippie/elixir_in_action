# Todo

This code is based on [the book _Elixir in Action_ by Saša Jurić](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action).

Unlike _Programming Phoenix_, this book goes over concepts of distributed systems in more detail and discusses
persistence to a finer degree.

I read this book first, before proceeding to _Programming Phoenix_ which lead to the development of
[Watch Together](https://github.com/colelawrence/phoenix_watch_together).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `todo` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:todo, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/todo](https://hexdocs.pm/todo).
